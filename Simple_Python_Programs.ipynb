        "### What is an Expert System?\n",
        "\n",
        "An **Expert System** is a computer program that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. It is designed to solve complex problems and provide decision support in a particular domain by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented primarily as if-then rules rather than conventional procedural code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Components of an Expert System:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Knowledge Base**:\n",
        "    *   **Purpose**: The knowledge base serves as the system's long-term memory, storing all the domain-specific knowledge required to solve problems. It's akin to the expert's understanding, experience, and factual information.\n",
        "    *   **Contents**: It typically contains:\n",
        "        *   **Facts**: Declarative information about the domain (e.g., \"If a patient has a fever, then...\").\n",
        "        *   **Rules**: Heuristics, associations, and relationships often expressed as IF-THEN statements (e.g., \"IF the engine does not start AND the battery is dead THEN recharge the battery\").\n",
        "        *   **Concepts**: Definitions and relationships between domain objects.\n",
        "        *   **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Inference Engine**:\n",
        "    *   **Purpose**: The inference engine is the \"brain\" of the expert system. Its primary function is to interpret and manipulate the knowledge stored in the knowledge base to draw conclusions, make recommendations, or find solutions to user queries.\n",
        "    *   **Function**: It employs reasoning strategies, such as:\n",
        "        *   **Forward Chaining**: Data-driven approach, starting with known facts and deriving conclusions.\n",
        "        *   **Backward Chaining**: Goal-driven approach, starting with a goal and attempting to prove it by finding supporting facts.\n",
        "        *   **Pattern Matching**: Identifying patterns in data to match them with rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **User Interface**:\n",
        "    *   **Purpose**: The user interface (UI) is the component that facilitates communication between the user and the expert system. It enables users to input problems, ask questions, and receive solutions or explanations.\n",
        "    *   **Role**: It ensures user-friendliness and often provides:\n",
        "        *   **Input Mechanisms**: For users to enter data or pose questions.\n",
        "        *   **Output Displays**: To present the system's conclusions, advice, or explanations in an understandable format.\n",
        "        *   **Explanation Facilities**: To clarify the reasoning process the system used to arrive at a particular conclusion, enhancing user trust and understanding."

        "*   **Expert System Definition**: An expert system is defined as a computer program that mimics human expert decision-making, solving complex problems by reasoning through a knowledge base, primarily using if-then rules.\n",
        "*   **Core Components**: The system's architecture includes:\n",
        "    *   A **Knowledge Base** storing domain-specific facts, rules (if-then statements), concepts, and procedures.\n",
        "    *   An **Inference Engine** which is the system's \"brain,\" interpreting knowledge and drawing conclusions using strategies like forward or backward chaining.\n",
        "    *   A **User Interface** for user interaction, input, output, and explanation facilities.\n",
        "*   **Decision-Making Scenario**: The expert system was designed to provide activity recommendations based on weather conditions.\n",
        "*   **Defined Conditions**: The key conditions for recommendations are `Temperature` (e.g., 'hot', 'mild', 'cold'), `Precipitation` (e.g., 'none', 'light_rain', 'heavy_rain', 'snow'), and `Sky Condition` (e.g., 'sunny', 'cloudy', 'overcast').\n",
        "*   **Rule Set**: A total of 7 simple 'if-then' rules were formulated to link combinations of weather conditions to specific activity recommendations. For example:\n",
        "    *   \"IF Temperature is 'hot' AND Sky Condition is 'sunny' THEN Recommend: 'Go swimming or to the beach.'\"\n",
        "    *   \"IF Precipitation is 'heavy\\_rain' THEN Recommend: 'Stay indoors, read a book, or watch a movie.'\"\n",
        "*   **Python Implementation**:\n",
        "    *   The knowledge base was implemented as a Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represented a rule with 'conditions' and a 'recommendation'.\n",
        "    *   A `inference_engine` Python function was created to process user-provided facts against these rules. It successfully identifies matching rules and returns the corresponding recommendation, or a default message if no rule applies.\n",
        "*   **Demonstrated Capabilities**: The expert system successfully processed various example scenarios (e.g., 'sunny and hot', 'rainy and cold', 'snowy') and provided appropriate recommendations, including handling cases where no rule matched the input facts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current expert system effectively demonstrates basic rule-based reasoning for activity recommendations. Its capabilities can be expanded by incorporating more complex rules, additional input parameters (e.g., user preferences, time of day, day of the week), and allowing for multiple recommendations.\n",
        "*   To enhance user experience and practical applicability, the system could benefit from a more sophisticated user interface, an explanation facility to show how a recommendation was reached, and the ability to dynamically update or learn new rules from user feedback or external data.\n"
