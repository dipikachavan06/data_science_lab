        "\n",
        "A* is a popular pathfinding algorithm, widely used in various applications like games, robotics, and logistics. It is an informed search algorithm, meaning it uses a heuristic function to guide its search, making it more efficient than uninformed search algorithms like BFS or DFS for finding the shortest path.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How A* Works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A* works by maintaining two lists:\n",
        "1.  **Open List (Frontier):** Contains nodes that have been visited but whose neighbors haven't all been explored yet.\n",
        "2.  **Closed List:** Contains nodes that have been fully evaluated.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each node, A* calculates a cost function `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`:\n",
        "*   `g(n)`: The actual cost from the start node to the current node `n`.\n",
        "*   `h(n)`: The estimated cost (heuristic) from the current node `n` to the end node. This heuristic must be admissible (never overestimates the cost).\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm iteratively expands the node with the lowest `f(n)` value from the open list until the goal node is reached or the open list is empty."
